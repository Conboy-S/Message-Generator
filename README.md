# Message-Generator v1

This project is intended to demonstrate the ability to create a working random message generator using Java Script.
I intend to revisit and update this project as my skills develop to eventually simulate a prize draw website, commonly seen from big brands complete with full web design.
The first commit was coded from memory but didn't work on the command line when tested with Node.
The second commit had the function removed and was used to ensure the command line could access the file.
The third commit had the initial function added and tests showed a syntax error in the console logging
Fourth commit has function working as intended.
